geoopt layers
=============

Experimental layers to be used along with `geoopt`_ package

Design
------
With recent `geoopt`_ Manifold tensors have become first class citizens in pytorch autograd.
It is extremely convenient to use the supplied manifold information about the tensor.
This should make Riemannian deep learning closer to the community.
