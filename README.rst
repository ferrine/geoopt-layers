geoopt layers
=============

Experimental layers to be used along with `geoopt`_ package

Motivation
----------
Deep learning frameworks have developed enough to deal with Euclidean spaces.
However, little done for deep learning on Riemannian manifolds. The purpose of ``geoopt_layers``
is to accelerate research in Riemannian deep learning making it easier for researchers
to test their bright ideas.
